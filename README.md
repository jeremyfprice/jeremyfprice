# 👋 Hi, I’m @jeremyfprice

I am Assistant Professor of Technology, Innovation, and Pedagogy in the [Indiana University School of Education-Indianapolis](https://education.iupui.edu/) at [IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu). I work to engage and build capacity and capital for marginalized and minoritized youth and community to build, strengthen, and sustain an inclusive and just democratic project.
